This is a [Sublime Text][sublime] package which includes a bunch of handy snippets for doing WordPress development with the Genesis Framework.

## Installation ##

### With Package Control ###

If you have the [Package Control][package_control] package installed, you can install the Genesis package from inside Sublime Text itself. Open the Command Palette and select "Package Control: Install Package", then search for Genesis.

It's just that simple!

### Without Package Control ###

If you haven't got Package Control installed (seriously, go install it!) you will need to make a clone of this repository into your packages folder, like so:

    git clone https://github.com/jtallant/genesis.git Genesis Snippets
